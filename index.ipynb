    "\n",
    "So we have learned quite a bit about APIs and how they are now big buzzword in the tech industry. Think of it as a protocol for how to make requests and communicate with another server. We have seen how to mine Twitter for getting text data and apply basic frequency based NLP techniques to get some insight. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key aspects of being a data scientist is the ability to learn how a new API works, how to go through its specific authentication process (OAuth) and how to process the data structures that get returned as a response to our requests. It is a good practice to spend some time learning the API through the official documentation before sending in requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "On these lines, this lab requires you to learn another popular API (YELP Fusion) by following the provided detailed online documentation. We shall build a simple Geographical Information System (GIS) using the data from yelp."
